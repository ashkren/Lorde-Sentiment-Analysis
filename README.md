# Lorde-Sentiment-Analysis

This project analyzes the lyrical themes and sentiments of Lorde's songs using NLP techniques. The goal is to understand how Lorde's song themes and sentiments have evolved over time, and to explore correlations between lyrical sentiment and audio features (such as danceability, energy, and valence) obtained from the Spotify API.
